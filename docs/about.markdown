I've been working in data science for the past 9 years, mostly in the realm of Product Analytics. My focus has been building interpretable models for actionable insights.

Recently I've been working with an AgTech startup investigating the use of machine learning for forecasting and early detection of crop disease.

On the side, I've been playing around with deep learning in the audio domain and exploring time series modeling on open source data.
